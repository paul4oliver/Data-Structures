# Data-Structures

The purpose of the code in the repository is to explore data algorithms and structures. 

Each cpp file reads data from a CSV file containing municipal government data feed with bids submitted for auction of property.

The vector file implements quick sort and selection sort to sort the bids. The vector reflection explains the purpose of the code and the flow chart outlines the logic behind it.

The files for binary search tree, linked list, and hash table demonstrate the implementations of insert, search, and delete methods for each structure.  I reflected on each data structureâ€™s performance and my own experience developing the code for these assignments and how I overcame obstacles. I also created flow charts for each structure to aid in my code development.
